## Testing

This is an exercise on creating custom python shell as part of the Secure Software Development course of the CS PgCert at the University of Essex Online. 

## Instructions

Review the blogs at Praka (2018) and Szabo (n.d.) and then create a CLI/ shell that implements the following:

When you enter the command LIST it lists the contents of the current directory
The ADD command will add the following two numbers together and provide the result
The HELP command provides a list of commands available
The EXIT command exits the shell

*What happens when the code is run?*

I received the following prompt:

Welcome! Type ? to list commands
pb> 


## Questions

What are the two main security vulnerabilities with your shell?
